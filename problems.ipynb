    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/modules/computer-science/deutsch-jozsa), first proposed by David Deutsch and Richard Jozsa in 1992, represents one of the earliest and most elegant demonstrations of quantum computational advantage. The algorithm operates on a restricted class of [Boolean functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_function) - mathematical functions that map binary inputs to binary outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Boolean function with $n$ inputs can be represented as $f: \\{0,1\\}^n \\rightarrow \\{0,1\\}$, mapping each of the $2^n$ possible input combinations to either 0 or 1 (or equivalently, `False` or `True` in Python). For $n=4$, there are $2^{16} = 65,536$ possible Boolean functions in total. However, the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm restricts attention to two special classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Constant functions**: Return the same value for all inputs. There are exactly 2 such functions (one that always returns 0, and one that always returns 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Balanced functions**: Return 0 for exactly half of the inputs and 1 for the other half. For $n=4$, there are $\\binom{16}{8} = 12,870$ such functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem asks us to implement a function generator that randomly produces either a constant or balanced function with 4 Boolean inputs. This type of function is essential for testing and demonstrating the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Classical vs Quantum Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding why we restrict to constant and balanced functions requires understanding the classical-quantum comparison. In classical computing, to determine with certainty whether an unknown function $f$ is constant or balanced, we must evaluate it on multiple inputs. In the worst case, we need $2^{n-1} + 1$ queries (for $n=4$, that's 9 queries) to be 100% certain. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the Deutsch-Jozsa quantum algorithm can solve this problem with just **one** quantum query to the function, regardless of the number of inputs $n$. This exponential speedup demonstrates what Deutsch and Jozsa called \"quantum parallelism\" - the ability of quantum computers to evaluate a function on multiple inputs simultaneously through [superposition](https://www.quantamagazine.org/what-is-quantum-superposition-20220105/).\n",
    "\n",
    "While this is often called a \"toy problem\" because it requires the promise that the function is either constant or balanced (which is an artificial restriction), it serves an important pedagogical purpose. As noted by [Nielsen and Chuang (2010)](https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/quantum-computation-and-quantum-information/01E10196D0A682A6AEFFEA52D53BE9AE) in their seminal textbook *Quantum Computation and Quantum Information*, such promise problems help us understand the fundamental differences between classical and quantum computation.\n",

    "### Implementation Design Decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "The function above uses several key Python programming concepts that are worth discussing in detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Closures as Function Factories\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation uses [Python closures](https://realpython.com/inner-functions-what-are-they-good-for/#closures-and-factory-functions) to create functions dynamically. A closure is a function object that has access to variables in its enclosing lexical scope, even after the outer function has finished executing. In our case:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For constant functions, the inner `constant_function` captures the `constant_value` variable\n",
    "- For balanced functions, the inner `balanced_function` captures the `true_inputs` set\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern is called a \"factory function\" - a function that creates and returns other functions. This approach is elegant and follows functional programming principles, making the code more modular and easier to test.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Time and Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "The complexity analysis of this implementation reveals interesting trade-offs:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constant Functions:**\n",
    "- **Generation time**: O(1) - just need to randomly choose a Boolean value\n",
    "- **Evaluation time**: O(1) - always return the same value\n",
    "- **Space**: O(1) - only stores a single Boolean value\n",
    "\n",
    "**Balanced Functions:**\n",
    "- **Generation time**: O(2^n) where n=4, so O(16) - need to generate all input combinations\n",
    "- **Evaluation time**: O(1) average case - set membership testing using hash tables\n",
    "- **Space**: O(2^n) = O(16) - stores the set of \"True\" inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "For larger values of $n$, this approach would become impractical. Alternative implementations might use:\n",
    "- **Explicit formulas**: Some balanced functions (like parity functions) can be computed with simple formulas, requiring O(1) space\n",
    "- **Lazy generation**: Generate balanced outputs on-the-fly using a seeded random number generator\n",
    "- **Compressed representations**: Use mathematical properties to represent balanced functions more compactly\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for $n=4$ (16 inputs), our direct approach is simple, clear, and efficient enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Why Use Sets for Membership Testing?\n",
    "\n",
    "We convert the list from `random.sample()` to a set because sets provide O(1) average-case lookup time using [hash tables](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets), while lists require O(n) linear search. Given that we'll potentially call the balanced function many times during testing, this optimization is worthwhile. The trade-off is slightly higher memory usage (sets have more overhead than lists), but this is negligible for only 8 elements."

However, for larger $n$ (e.g., $n=10$ requires checking 1,024 inputs; $n=20$ requires over 1 million), exhaustive testing becomes computationally expensive.\n",
